// Two pointers

/* which is mostly used in arrays,Linked lists,strings.

Arrays and strings:
1. polynomial pointers --->finding the subarrays O(n^2)complexity.

2. Rivaling pointers (Binary search algorithm).

3. Multiple Pointers(Dutch flag problem):sorting of 0,1,2 array.

4 Double input pointers for the merging of the arrays.

5.Sliding Windows Ex: fixed window pattern 

Linked list:
1.pointer chasing ("Slow and Fast" or "Tortoise and Hare")for Cycle Detection.

Companies that two - pointers ask :

Google

Facebook

Microsoft

Airbnb


When to use two pointers:

1. When their is a sorted array .

2. to eliminate the redundant computations

Some senarios where to use:

> Searching pairs in a sorted array.
> Finding a cycle in a linked list.
> Checking for a plaindromes.
> Applying a sliding Window.


!!!!! ***IMP TO REMEMBER **** !!!!


> during interviews be cousious while traversing the array.
> don't forget to change the poistions of the pointers.
> Remember to have a edge cases and how the things need to be change their.
